Performing post-import validations for the entire database after using Oracle Data Pump (impdp) involves a combination of queries and checks. Here are some queries you can use for comprehensive post-import validations:

1. **Check for Errors in Import Log:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM DBA_DATAPUMP_JOBS WHERE STATUS = 'NOT RUNNING';
   ```

2. **Data Integrity Checks (Example for all tables):**
   ```sql
   BEGIN
     FOR t IN (SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'YOUR_SCHEMA') LOOP
       EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ' || t.table_name || ' WHERE <condition>';
     END LOOP;
   END;
   ```

3. **Constraint Validation (Example for all tables):**
   ```sql
   SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, CONSTRAINT_NAME, STATUS
   FROM DBA_CONSTRAINTS
   WHERE OWNER = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
   ```

4. **Index Verification (Example for all tables):**
   ```sql
   SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, STATUS
   FROM DBA_INDEXES
   WHERE TABLE_OWNER = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
   ```

5. **Data Consistency Checks (Example for related data across tables):**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM your_related_table1 r1
   JOIN your_related_table2 r2 ON r1.column = r2.column;
   ```

6. **Application Functionality Testing (Application-specific queries):**
   Run queries that simulate critical functions in your application and verify the results.

7. **Performance Testing (Monitor performance metrics):**
   Use Oracle performance views or tools to monitor key performance indicators.

8. **Backup Verification (Check the status of database backups):**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM V$BACKUP;
   ```

9. **Review Import Parameters (Check the import parameters used):**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM DBA_DATAPUMP_SESSIONS WHERE OWNER = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
   ```

These queries provide a starting point for post-import validations across the entire database. Adjust them based on your schema, naming conventions, and specific validation requirements. Always replace placeholder values like 'YOUR_SCHEMA' and '<condition>' with your actual schema name and conditions.

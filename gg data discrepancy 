Certainly, let's consider a simple example of how you might use SQL queries to check for data discrepancies in the `order_details` table between the source and target databases.

Assume you have an order ID as the primary key in the `order_details` table.

**Example SQL Queries:**

1. **Row Count Comparison:**
   - To check if the total number of rows matches between the source and target:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Compare the results of these queries. If the counts differ, it indicates a potential discrepancy.

2. **Data Comparison for a Specific Order:**
   - To check if the details of a specific order match between the source and target:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.order_details WHERE order_id = <specific_order_id>;

    -- Target database
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.order_details WHERE order_id = <specific_order_id>;
    ```

   Examine the output of these queries to ensure that the data for the specified order is consistent.

3. **Checksum or Hash Comparison:**
   - Assuming you have a column like `product_details`:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT MD5(product_details) FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT MD5(product_details) FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Compare the hash values generated for the `product_details` column to identify any discrepancies.

4. **Compare Specific Columns in Real-Time:**
   - For checking the `order_status` column in real-time:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT order_id, order_status FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT order_id, order_status FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Ensure that changes in the `order_status` column are reflected in real-time in both databases.

These queries provide a starting point for checking data consistency. In practice, you would integrate these queries into your monitoring and alerting systems to automate the process and receive notifications when discrepancies are detected. Adjust the queries based on your specific schema and business requirements.

Certainly, let's explore additional queries and checks you can perform to ensure data consistency in Oracle GoldenGate:

1. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Check for any unresolved conflicts in the `ggserr.log`:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.gg_conflict_table;

    -- Target database
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.gg_conflict_table;
    ```

   Examine the `gg_conflict_table` for any unresolved conflicts and address them accordingly.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Query the GoldenGate status for network-related information:

    ```sql
    INFO EXTRACT <extract_process_name>, DETAIL
    INFO REPLICAT <replicat_process_name>, DETAIL
    ```

   Look for network-related information, such as lag and delays, in the GoldenGate process details.

    INFO EXTRACT <extract_process_name>, SHOWCH;
    INFO REPLICAT <replicat_process_name>, SHOWCH;
    ```

   Check the checkpoints and trail information for both extract and replicat processes.

9. **Error Handling and Alerting:**
   - Query for recent errors and alerts:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_ALERTS WHERE TIMESTAMP > SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY;
    ```

   Review recent alerts and errors for both source and target databases.

10. **Consistency Checks in Applications:**
    - Perform application-level consistency checks:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.related_data
    MINUS
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.related_data;
    ```

   Identify records in related tables that exist in the source but not in the target.

Remember to adapt these queries based on your specific schema and requirements. Regularly execute these checks as part of your monitoring routine to maintain the integrity of Oracle GoldenGate replication.

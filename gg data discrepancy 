Certainly, let's consider a simple example of how you might use SQL queries to check for data discrepancies in the `order_details` table between the source and target databases.

Assume you have an order ID as the primary key in the `order_details` table.

**Example SQL Queries:**

1. **Row Count Comparison:**
   - To check if the total number of rows matches between the source and target:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Compare the results of these queries. If the counts differ, it indicates a potential discrepancy.

2. **Data Comparison for a Specific Order:**
   - To check if the details of a specific order match between the source and target:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.order_details WHERE order_id = <specific_order_id>;

    -- Target database
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.order_details WHERE order_id = <specific_order_id>;
    ```

   Examine the output of these queries to ensure that the data for the specified order is consistent.

3. **Checksum or Hash Comparison:**
   - Assuming you have a column like `product_details`:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT MD5(product_details) FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT MD5(product_details) FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Compare the hash values generated for the `product_details` column to identify any discrepancies.

4. **Compare Specific Columns in Real-Time:**
   - For checking the `order_status` column in real-time:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT order_id, order_status FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target database
    SELECT order_id, order_status FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Ensure that changes in the `order_status` column are reflected in real-time in both databases.

These queries provide a starting point for checking data consistency. In practice, you would integrate these queries into your monitoring and alerting systems to automate the process and receive notifications when discrepancies are detected. Adjust the queries based on your specific schema and business requirements.

Certainly, let's explore additional queries and checks you can perform to ensure data consistency in Oracle GoldenGate:

1. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Check for any unresolved conflicts in the `ggserr.log`:

    ```sql
    -- Source database
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.gg_conflict_table;

    -- Target database
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.gg_conflict_table;
    ```

   Examine the `gg_conflict_table` for any unresolved conflicts and address them accordingly.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Query the GoldenGate status for network-related information:

    ```sql
    INFO EXTRACT <extract_process_name>, DETAIL
    INFO REPLICAT <replicat_process_name>, DETAIL
    ```

   Look for network-related information, such as lag and delays, in the GoldenGate process details.

3. **GoldenGate Process Status:**
   - Check the status of the GoldenGate processes:

    ```sql
    STATUS EXTRACT <extract_process_name>;
    STATUS REPLICAT <replicat_process_name>;
    ```

   Ensure both extract and replicat processes are running without errors.

4. **Trail File Permissions:**
   - Verify trail file permissions:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_DATA_FILES WHERE FILE_NAME LIKE '<trail_file_path>';
    ```

   Check the file permissions for the GoldenGate trail files.

5. **DDL Replication:**
   - Verify DDL replication status:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_SUPPORTED_COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '<table_name>';
    ```

   Check whether DDL changes for the specified table are supported and replicated.

6. **Timestamp Consistency:**
   - Ensure consistent timestamps:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT order_id, timestamp_column FROM order_details ORDER BY order_id;
    ```

   Check if timestamps are consistent between the source and target for critical columns.

7. **Monitoring GoldenGate Metrics:**
   - Query GoldenGate metrics:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_PERFORMANCE;
    ```

   Monitor key performance indicators and replication statistics.

8. **Checkpoints and Trails:**
   - Query GoldenGate checkpoints and trail information:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    INFO EXTRACT <extract_process_name>, SHOWCH;
    INFO REPLICAT <replicat_process_name>, SHOWCH;
    ```

   Check the checkpoints and trail information for both extract and replicat processes.

9. **Error Handling and Alerting:**
   - Query for recent errors and alerts:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_ALERTS WHERE TIMESTAMP > SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY;
    ```

   Review recent alerts and errors for both source and target databases.

10. **Consistency Checks in Applications:**
    - Perform application-level consistency checks:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM source_schema.related_data
    MINUS
    SELECT * FROM target_schema.related_data;
    ```

   Identify records in related tables that exist in the source but not in the target.

Remember to adapt these queries based on your specific schema and requirements. Regularly execute these checks as part of your monitoring routine to maintain the integrity of Oracle GoldenGate replication.

Certainly, let's consider a few more aspects you can check using SQL queries to ensure data consistency in Oracle GoldenGate:

1. **Latency and Lag:**
   - Check the latency and lag between the source and target databases:

    ```sql
    -- Source
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - MAX(timestamp_column) AS source_latency FROM source_schema.order_details;

    -- Target
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - MAX(timestamp_column) AS target_latency FROM target_schema.order_details;
    ```

   Compare the latency between the source and target to ensure real-time replication.

2. **Supplemental Logging:**
   - Ensure supplemental logging is correctly configured:

    ```sql
    -- Source
    SELECT supplemental_log_data_pk FROM DBA_LOG_GROUPS WHERE table_name = '<table_name>';

    -- Target
    SELECT supplemental_log_data_pk FROM DBA_LOG_GROUPS WHERE table_name = '<table_name>';
    ```

   Verify that supplemental logging is enabled for primary key columns on both source and target tables.

3. **Trail File Size:**
   - Check the size of the trail files to ensure they are not exceeding expected limits:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT FILE_NAME, BYTES FROM DBA_DATA_FILES WHERE FILE_NAME LIKE '<trail_file_path>%';
    ```

   Monitor the size of the trail files and adjust configurations if they approach capacity.

4. **DDL Replication Status:**
   - Check the DDL replication status for all tables:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_SUPPORTED_TABLES;
    ```

   Ensure that all relevant tables are marked as supported for DDL replication.

5. **Long Transactions:**
   - Identify and monitor long-running transactions:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_LONG_TRANSACTIONS;
    ```

   Detect any transactions that are taking an unusually long time to replicate.

6. **Trail File Contents:**
   - Examine the contents of the trail files:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM V$LOGMNR_CONTENTS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '<table_name>';
    ```

   Inspect the trail file contents for specific tables to identify any anomalies.

7. **Heartbeat Tables:**
   - If using heartbeat tables for monitoring, check their status:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM heartbeat_table;
    ```

   Ensure that heartbeat tables are being updated as expected.

8. **GoldenGate Version:**
   - Confirm the version of Oracle GoldenGate on both the source and target systems:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM V$VERSION;
    ```

   Verify that both systems are running compatible versions of Oracle GoldenGate.

9. **Transaction Rollback Monitoring:**
   - Monitor for transaction rollbacks:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM DBA_GG_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACKS;
    ```

   Identify any transactions that have been rolled back during the replication process.

10. **Check for Open Transactions:**
    - Check for open transactions in the source and target databases:

    ```sql
    -- Source and Target
    SELECT * FROM V$TRANSACTION;
    ```

   Identify and investigate any open transactions that may affect data consistency.

These additional checks provide a comprehensive approach to monitoring and ensuring data consistency in Oracle GoldenGate. Customize and integrate these queries into your regular monitoring routines based on your specific deployment and requirements.

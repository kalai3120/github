To find which user is generating more archive logs in an Oracle database, you can query the `V$SESSION` and `V$SQL` views to identify the SQL statements executed by each user. Here's a query that can help you identify the user generating more archive logs:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       s.sid,
       s.serial#,
       s.sql_id,
       s.program,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.username, s.sid, s.serial#, s.sql_id, s.program
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

This query joins the `V$SESSION` and `V$SQL` views based on the `SQL_ID` column and counts the occurrences for each user. It provides information about the username, session ID (SID), serial number, SQL ID, program, and the count of archive log generation.

Inspect the result to identify the user and associated SQL statements contributing to the high number of archive log generation. This information can help you understand which user's activities are causing increased archiving in the Oracle database.

To narrow down the query to a particular time period, you can add a time-based condition in the `WHERE` clause. Here's an example query that focuses on a specific time period:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       s.sid,
       s.serial#,
       s.sql_id,
       s.program,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND s.logon_time BETWEEN TO_DATE('2024-01-13 08:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') 
                       AND TO_DATE('2024-01-13 12:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') -- Specify your time range
GROUP BY s.username, s.sid, s.serial#, s.sql_id, s.program
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

Adjust the `TO_DATE` function parameters in the `BETWEEN` clause to specify your desired time range. This example assumes a time range between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM on January 13, 2024. Update the date and time values according to your specific period of interest.

To specifically focus on archive generation within a particular time period, you can query the `V$ARCHIVE_DEST` and `V$ARCHIVE` views. Here's an example query that provides information about archive generation for a specific time range:

```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(completion_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS archive_time,
       dest_id,
       dest_name,
       archived,
       applied
FROM v$archive_dest ad
JOIN v$archive a ON ad.dest_id = a.dest_id
WHERE completion_time BETWEEN TO_DATE('2024-01-13 08:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') 
                        AND TO_DATE('2024-01-13 12:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') -- Specify your time range
ORDER BY completion_time;
```

Adjust the `TO_DATE` function parameters in the `BETWEEN` clause to specify your desired time range. This query provides details about archive completion time, destination ID, destination name, and the number of archived and applied logs.

Reviewing the results will give you insights into archive generation during the specified time period, helping you identify trends and potential contributors.

To find which users have generated more archives in the past 4 days in an Oracle database, you can use the following query. This query considers the archive logs generated by each user in the specified time frame:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
JOIN v$archive a ON s.sid = a.session_id
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND a.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY s.username
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

This query joins the `V$SESSION`, `V$SQL`, and `V$ARCHIVE` views, filtering sessions with non-null SQL IDs and archive logs completed within the last 4 days. It counts the number of archives generated by each user and presents the results in descending order.

Adjust the time frame in the `a.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY` condition to match the specific past 4 days you are interested in.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or potential variation in your Oracle database schema. The `session_id` might not be directly available in `V$ARCHIVE`.

Let's modify the query to use `SID` instead. Here's an updated version:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
JOIN v$archive a ON s.sid = a.sid
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND a.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY s.username
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

In this version, I've replaced `a.session_id` with `a.sid`. Please try running this query and let me know if it resolves the issue.



I apologize for the oversight. It seems I provided an incorrect column name. In Oracle, the correct column for the session ID in the `V$ARCHIVE` view is `SESSION_ID`. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
JOIN v$archive a ON s.sid = a.session_id
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND a.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY s.username
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

Please try running this corrected query, and it should work without the "sid is invalid identifier" error.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made an error in my previous responses. The correct column for session ID in `V$ARCHIVE` is `SID` instead of `SESSION_ID`. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
JOIN v$archive a ON s.sid = a.sid
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND a.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY s.username
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

I appreciate your patience. Please try running this corrected query, and it should work without the "sid is invalid identifier" error.




I apologize for the confusion, and I appreciate your patience. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the available views. In some Oracle versions, the `V$ARCHIVE` view does not directly contain the session information.

Let's modify the query to use the `V$LOG_HISTORY` view, which should provide the necessary information:

```sql
SELECT s.username,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$session s
JOIN v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
JOIN v$log_history lh ON s.sid = lh.session_id
WHERE s.sql_id IS NOT NULL
  AND lh.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY s.username
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

This query uses `V$LOG_HISTORY` instead of `V$ARCHIVE` to associate the session information with the archive logs. Please try running this modified query, and let me know if it resolves the issue.


I apologize for the continued inconvenience. It appears that I provided incorrect information in my previous responses. I appreciate your understanding.

In Oracle, there is no direct correlation between the session ID (`SID`) and the archive logs. My earlier attempts to link these might have caused confusion.

To find the users generating more archives, you may need to rely on other indirect methods such as monitoring the `V$ARCHIVE_DEST` view or using Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) if available.

Here is a simplified query that checks archive generation by destination, which may give you some insights:

```sql
SELECT dest_id,
       dest_name,
       COUNT(*) AS archive_count
FROM v$archive_dest ad
WHERE ad.COMPLETION_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4' DAY
GROUP BY dest_id, dest_name
ORDER BY archive_count DESC;
```

This query provides information on archive counts per destination in the last 4 days. Unfortunately, it won't directly attribute archive generation to specific users.

For a more detailed analysis of archive generation by user, you might want to consider leveraging Oracle's diagnostic tools or monitoring solutions that are designed to provide such information. I apologize for any confusion caused by the earlier responses.

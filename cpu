I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `SAMPLE_TIME` is not directly available in the `DBA_HIST_OSSTAT` view. Instead, you can use the `SNAP_ID` in conjunction with the `DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` view to get the timestamp. Here's an updated query:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(s.SAMPLE_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    os.VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'CPU Usage Per Sec'
    AND s.SAMPLE_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.SAMPLE_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.SAMPLE_TIME;
```

This query includes the `DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` view to associate the `SNAP_ID` with the timestamp. Adjust the `ROWNUM` condition based on your desired interval. Ensure that you have the necessary privileges to query the relevant views or consult your database administrator for access.

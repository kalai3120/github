I apologize for the inconvenience. The availability of specific statistics may vary based on Oracle Database versions and configurations. Let's simplify the query further and focus on a more commonly available metric.

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(SNAP_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'BUSY_TIME'
    AND s.SNAP_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.SNAP_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.SNAP_TIME;
```

This query uses the `BUSY_TIME` statistic, which represents the time the CPU spent in busy mode. Please try running this modified query. If it still doesn't return any rows, it might be worth checking the available statistics in your specific Oracle Database version and configuration. You may also want to consult with your database administrator to ensure proper access and visibility into these statistics.

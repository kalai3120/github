I apologize for any confusion. Let's modify the query to ensure we're using the correct columns and conditions. In Oracle, the statistics related to CPU usage can vary based on the version and platform. Here's an example that should work for Oracle Database 11g and 12c:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    os.VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'Busy Time (centiseconds)'
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME;
```

This query uses the `Busy Time (centiseconds)` statistic for CPU usage and the `BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME` column for the snapshot timestamp. Please adjust the conditions and statistics based on your specific Oracle Database version and the statistics available in your environment.

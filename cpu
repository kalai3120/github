I appreciate your patience. Let's simplify the query and focus on a more common metric. Try using the `LOAD_PROFILE` statistic, which represents the CPU usage in centiseconds. Here's an adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    os.VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'LOAD_PROFILE'
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME;
```

This query uses the `LOAD_PROFILE` statistic, which should be available in most Oracle Database versions. It represents the load on the system, including CPU usage.

Please adjust the query as needed, and ensure that your user has the necessary privileges to query these tables. If the query still returns no rows, it's possible that the specific statistics you're looking for may not be available in your Oracle Database version or that there might be specific configurations affecting the data in your environment.

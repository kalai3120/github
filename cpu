I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made an error in my response. The correct column for timestamp in `DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` is `BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME`. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    os.VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'CPU used by this session'
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME;
```

This query should now correctly use `BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME` as the timestamp column. Please adjust the `ROWNUM` condition based on your desired interval. I appreciate your patience, and I hope this resolves the issue.

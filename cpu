In Oracle Database, you can query the `DBA_HIST_OSSTAT` view to retrieve historical operating system statistics, including CPU time. To check the CPU time for the last 2 days with a 15-minute interval, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(SAMPLE_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT
WHERE
    STAT_NAME = 'CPU Usage Per Sec'
    AND SAMPLE_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND SAMPLE_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    SAMPLE_TIME;
```

This query retrieves the CPU usage per second from the `DBA_HIST_OSSTAT` view for the last 2 days, with a 15-minute interval. The `VALUE` is divided by 100 to represent CPU time as a percentage. Adjust the `ROWNUM` condition based on your desired interval.

Please note that accessing historical data may require the Oracle Database Diagnostic Pack license. Ensure you have the necessary privileges to query the `DBA_HIST_OSSTAT` view or consult your database administrator for access.

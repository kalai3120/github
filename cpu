I apologize for the confusion. It appears that I made an error in my previous responses. The `DBA_HIST_OSSTAT` view does not have a direct column named `SAMPLE_TIME`. Instead, we need to use the `DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` view to obtain the timestamp associated with each snapshot.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(s.SNAP_TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') AS SAMPLE_TIME,
    os.VALUE / 100 AS CPU_TIME_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DBA_HIST_OSSTAT os
JOIN
    DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT s ON os.SNAP_ID = s.SNAP_ID
WHERE
    os.STAT_NAME = 'CPU used by this session'
    AND s.SNAP_TIME >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND s.SNAP_TIME <= SYSTIMESTAMP
    AND ROWNUM <= 192 -- (2 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour) / 15 minutes/interval
ORDER BY
    s.SNAP_TIME;
```

This query uses `SNAP_TIME` from `DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` to represent the timestamp associated with each snapshot. Please adjust the `ROWNUM` condition based on your desired interval. I appreciate your understanding, and I hope this resolves the issue.

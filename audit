My apologies for the oversight. To address the error, you can use the `CAST` function to convert the TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to a TIMESTAMP before extracting the components. Here's an updated query:

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(SUM(EXTRACT(DAY FROM CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) - (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY)) * 24 * 60 * 60 +
              EXTRACT(HOUR FROM CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) - (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY)) * 60 * 60 +
              EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) - (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY)) * 60 +
              EXTRACT(SECOND FROM CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) - (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY))) / (1024 * 1024), 2) AS total_storage_MB
FROM 
  dba_audit_trail
WHERE 
  timestamp >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY;
```

This query first converts the TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to TIMESTAMP using `CAST` and then performs the necessary calculations. Adjust it based on your specific needs and Oracle database version.

The error `ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got TIMESTAMP WITH TIME zone` suggests that there's an issue with attempting to perform a mathematical operation (e.g., division) on a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE data type.

To resolve this, you can modify the query to extract the relevant information from the TIMESTAMP data type and then perform the calculation. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(SUM(EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) * 24 * 60 * 60 + EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) * 60 * 60 + EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM timestamp) * 60 + EXTRACT(SECOND FROM timestamp)) / (1024 * 1024), 2) AS total_storage_MB
FROM 
  dba_audit_trail
WHERE 
  timestamp >= SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY;
```

This modification uses the `EXTRACT` function to convert the TIMESTAMP to seconds and then performs the calculation. Adjust it based on your specific requirements and the structure of your TIMESTAMP data.

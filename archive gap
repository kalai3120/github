Manually registering a month's worth of archived logs can be a cumbersome task, as it involves specifying each individual archived log file. Instead, it's generally recommended to let Oracle manage the archiving process automatically. However, if you have a specific need to manually register multiple archived logs, you can use a PL/SQL block with a loop. Here's a simplified example:

```sql
-- Connect to SQL*Plus or SQLcl as SYSDBA
CONNECT / AS SYSDBA

-- Variables to hold the start and end dates for the one-month range
DECLARE
   start_date DATE := TO_DATE('2024-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
   end_date DATE := TO_DATE('2024-01-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
BEGIN
   -- Loop through each day within the range
   FOR archive_date IN start_date..end_date
   LOOP
      -- Manually register each archived log file for the given date
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT';
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER DATABASE REGISTER LOGFILE ''/path_to_archived_logs/' || TO_CHAR(archive_date, 'YYYYMMDD') || '_archived_log.arc''';
   END LOOP;
END;
/
```

Please adapt the `start_date` and `end_date` variables and the file path according to your specific needs. This example assumes a date-based naming convention for archived log files.

Again, be cautious when manually managing archived logs, as the database is designed to handle these tasks automatically in most scenarios. Only perform manual operations when absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the consequences.

To include the sequence column name in the query result, you can join the `ALL_TAB_COLUMNS` view. Here's the modified query:

```sql
col TABLE_OWNER for a20
col SEQUENCE_OWNER for a20
col TABLE_NAME for a40
col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30

SELECT
  d.TABLE_OWNER,
  d.TABLE_NAME,
  d.REFERENCED_OWNER AS SEQUENCE_OWNER,
  d.REFERENCED_NAME AS SEQUENCE_NAME,
  c.COLUMN_NAME AS SEQUENCE_COLUMN
FROM
  ALL_DEPENDENCIES d
JOIN
  ALL_TRIGGERS t
ON
  t.TRIGGER_NAME = d.NAME AND t.OWNER = d.OWNER
JOIN
  ALL_TAB_COLUMNS c
ON
  c.TABLE_NAME = d.REFERENCED_NAME AND c.OWNER = d.REFERENCED_OWNER
WHERE
  d.REFERENCED_TYPE = 'SEQUENCE' AND d.TABLE_OWNER IN ('PERISCOPE', 'PLUM');
```

This query should provide you with the sequence column name along with other information for the specified tables owned by 'PERISCOPE' or 'PLUM'. Adjust the column formatting (`col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30` in this case) as needed for your output.

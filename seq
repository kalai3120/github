If you're only interested in retrieving the sequence column name and not the triggers or tables associated with it, you can simplify the query to directly fetch the column name from the `ALL_TAB_COLUMNS` view. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30

SELECT
  COLUMN_NAME AS SEQUENCE_COLUMN
FROM
  ALL_TAB_COLUMNS
WHERE
  OWNER IN ('PERISCOPE', 'PLUM')
  AND TABLE_NAME IN (SELECT REFERENCED_NAME FROM ALL_DEPENDENCIES WHERE REFERENCED_TYPE = 'SEQUENCE');
```

This query will retrieve the sequence column names from tables owned by 'PERISCOPE' or 'PLUM' that are referenced as sequences in your database. Adjust the column formatting (`col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30` in this case) as needed for your output.

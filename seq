If the sequence is present but not being returned by the query, it's possible that there might be some issue with the query itself. Let's refine the query to ensure we're retrieving the sequence column names correctly. We'll directly query the `ALL_TAB_COLUMNS` view to get the sequence column names. Here's the updated query:

```sql
col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30

SELECT
  COLUMN_NAME AS SEQUENCE_COLUMN
FROM
  ALL_TAB_COLUMNS
WHERE
  TABLE_NAME IN (SELECT REFERENCED_NAME FROM ALL_DEPENDENCIES WHERE REFERENCED_TYPE = 'SEQUENCE')
  AND OWNER IN ('PERISCOPE', 'PLUM');
```

This query should directly fetch the column names that are referenced as sequences in tables owned by 'PERISCOPE' or 'PLUM'. If the sequence columns exist, this query should return them. If it still doesn't return anything, there might be another issue, such as permissions or data inconsistency, that needs to be addressed.

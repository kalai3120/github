I see the issue. It seems I mistakenly referenced `tab.table_name` in the `JOIN` condition instead of `col.table_name`. Let me correct that for you:

```sql
SELECT 
    seq.sequence_name,
    seq.sequence_owner,
    col.table_name,
    tab.owner AS table_owner,
    col.column_name
FROM 
    all_sequences seq
JOIN 
    all_tab_columns col ON instr(col.data_default, seq.sequence_name) > 0
JOIN 
    all_tables tab ON col.table_name = tab.table_name
WHERE 
    col.data_default LIKE '%.NEXTVAL%';
```

This corrected query should resolve the issue by using `col.table_name` to reference the table name in the join condition.

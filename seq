Apologies for the confusion. It seems I made another mistake. In Oracle, there isn't a direct column like `identify_column` that indicates whether a column uses a sequence. 

To find columns in tables that use sequences to generate their values, you can look for columns with default values that reference sequences. Here's a query you can use:

```sql
SELECT table_name, column_name
FROM all_tab_columns
WHERE column_name IN (
    SELECT column_name
    FROM all_tab_columns
    WHERE identity_column = 'YES'
);
```

This query retrieves the table name and column name from the `all_tab_columns` view where the column name matches those of identity columns. These columns often use sequences to generate their values.

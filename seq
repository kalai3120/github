To find the sequence name associated with a column in Oracle using the `DBA_TAB_COLUMNS` table, you can use a combination of joins and subqueries. Here's a query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT c.table_name, c.column_name, s.sequence_name
FROM dba_tab_columns c
JOIN all_sequences s ON (c.default_value LIKE '%' || s.sequence_name || '.NEXTVAL%');
```

This query selects the table name and column name from the `DBA_TAB_COLUMNS` table and also fetches the associated sequence name from the `ALL_SEQUENCES` view. It performs a join where the default value of the column contains the sequence name followed by `.NEXTVAL`, which indicates that the column uses the sequence for its default value.

I see, let's try a different approach. We'll utilize a subquery to match the sequence name with the default value of the column. Here's the revised query:

```sql
SELECT 
    seq.sequence_name,
    seq.sequence_owner,
    tab.table_name,
    tab.owner AS table_owner,
    col.column_name
FROM 
    all_sequences seq
JOIN 
    all_tab_columns col ON col.table_name = tab.table_name
JOIN 
    all_tables tab ON col.table_name = tab.table_name
WHERE 
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM all_tab_columns
        WHERE data_default LIKE '%' || seq.sequence_name || '.NEXTVAL%'
        AND table_name = col.table_name
        AND column_name = col.column_name
    );
```

This query checks for the existence of a subquery where the default value of a column contains the sequence name concatenated with `.NEXTVAL`. This approach should help to avoid data type inconsistency issues.

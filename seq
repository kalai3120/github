Apologies for the oversight. It seems I misunderstood your requirement. Let me correct that. We need to use aliases for the tables referenced in the query. Here's the revised version:

```sql
col TABLE_OWNER for a20
col SEQUENCE_OWNER for a20
col TABLE_NAME for a40
col SEQUENCE_COLUMN for a30

SELECT
  d.OWNER AS TABLE_OWNER,
  d.NAME AS TABLE_NAME,
  d.REFERENCED_OWNER AS SEQUENCE_OWNER,
  d.REFERENCED_NAME AS SEQUENCE_NAME,
  c.COLUMN_NAME AS SEQUENCE_COLUMN
FROM
  ALL_DEPENDENCIES d
JOIN
  ALL_TRIGGERS t
ON
  t.TRIGGER_NAME = d.NAME AND t.OWNER = d.OWNER
JOIN
  ALL_TAB_COLUMNS c
ON
  c.TABLE_NAME = d.REFERENCED_NAME AND c.OWNER = d.REFERENCED_OWNER
WHERE
  d.TYPE = 'TRIGGER' AND d.REFERENCED_TYPE = 'SEQUENCE' AND d.OWNER IN ('PERISCOPE', 'PLUM');
```

This should now work without any "invalid identifier" errors.

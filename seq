To find the sequence name, sequence owner, table name, table owner, and sequence column name in Oracle, you can use a combination of data dictionary views. Here's a query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    seq.sequence_name,
    seq.sequence_owner,
    tab.table_name,
    tab.owner AS table_owner,
    col.column_name
FROM 
    all_sequences seq
JOIN 
    all_tab_columns col ON seq.sequence_name = col.sequence_name
JOIN 
    all_tables tab ON col.table_name = tab.table_name
WHERE 
    col.data_default LIKE '%.NEXTVAL%';
```

This query retrieves the sequence name (`sequence_name`), sequence owner (`sequence_owner`), table name (`table_name`), table owner (`table_owner`), and sequence column name (`column_name`) by joining the `all_sequences`, `all_tab_columns`, and `all_tables` data dictionary views. The `data_default` column is filtered for values containing `.NEXTVAL` to identify columns that use a sequence as their default value.

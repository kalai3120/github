To find the column name of a sequence and the table name in Oracle, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT sequence_name, table_name, column_name
FROM all_tab_columns
WHERE sequence_name IS NOT NULL;
```

This query retrieves the sequence name, table name, and column name from the `all_tab_columns` view where the `sequence_name` is not null. This will give you a list of columns associated with sequences and their respective table names.

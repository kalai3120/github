Apologies for the confusion. Let's refine the query to ensure compatibility between data types. We'll need to adjust the join conditions to match the appropriate columns. Here's the updated query:

```sql
SELECT 
    seq.sequence_name,
    seq.sequence_owner,
    tab.table_name,
    tab.owner AS table_owner,
    col.column_name
FROM 
    all_sequences seq
JOIN 
    all_tab_columns col ON instr(col.data_default, seq.sequence_name) > 0
JOIN 
    all_tables tab ON col.table_name = tab.table_name
WHERE 
    col.data_default LIKE '%.NEXTVAL%';
```

This revised query should address the data type inconsistency issue by using the `INSTR` function to find the occurrence of the sequence name within the `data_default` column. This way, it ensures compatibility between data types when joining the `all_tab_columns` and `all_sequences` views.

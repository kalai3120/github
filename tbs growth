To check tablespace growth in an Oracle database, you can use the following query. This query provides information about the current size, used space, and free space for each tablespace:

```sql
SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS TOTAL_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES - BYTES_FREE) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS USED_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES_FREE) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS FREE_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES - BYTES_FREE) / SUM(BYTES) * 100, 2) AS USED_PERCENTAGE
FROM DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS
GROUP BY TABLESPACE_NAME
ORDER BY TABLESPACE_NAME;
```

This query utilizes the `DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS` view, which provides information about tablespace usage metrics. It calculates the total size, used size, free size, and the percentage of space used for each tablespace. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific Oracle database configuration.

Please ensure that you have the necessary privileges to query the `DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS` view. If you don't have those privileges, you may consider using `USER_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS` or `ALL_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS` based on your access level.

I apologize for the confusion. It appears I made an error in my previous responses. The correct view for checking tablespace growth in Oracle is often `DBA_FREE_SPACE` or `USER_FREE_SPACE` rather than `DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS`. Here's an example query using `DBA_FREE_SPACE`:

```sql
SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS TOTAL_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES - BYTES_USED) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS USED_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES_USED) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS FREE_SIZE_MB,
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES - BYTES_USED) / SUM(BYTES) * 100, 2) AS USED_PERCENTAGE
FROM DBA_FREE_SPACE
GROUP BY TABLESPACE_NAME
ORDER BY TABLESPACE_NAME;
```

This query uses the `DBA_FREE_SPACE` view, which provides information about the free space in tablespaces. It calculates the total size, used size, free size, and the percentage of space used for each tablespace.

Please adjust the column names based on your Oracle database schema and ensure that you have the necessary privileges to query the `DBA_FREE_SPACE` view. If you are using a specific user, you can replace `DBA_FREE_SPACE` with `USER_FREE_SPACE`.
